This repository contains code to simulate from and fit the BC-ILM models described in Ward, Deardon and Deeth (preprint) https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00815

The Julia code for model simulation/ fitting was tested and run in Julia v1.6.3.

Code for results analysis/ plots was tested and run in R v4.2.1.
